### Check out the [Quick Box Wiki](https://github.com/JMSDOnline/quick-box/wiki) for some reference material to common issues as well as Tips and Tricks __before__ you install... make sure it's the right fit for you. If you have an error of your own and need help, please open an issue.

This script has the following features

* A multi-user environment, complete with scripts to add and delete users.
* Linux Quota, to control how much space every user can use in the box. This can be controlled via the '__setdisk__' command.
* Customized Seedbox Dashboard located at https://SERVER_IP/
* HTTPs Downloads directory (https://SERVER_IP/${username}.downloads)
* Obscures ports for ssh and ftp. __SSH = 4747__ | __FTP = 5757__ (note, this is not for security reasons... it's simply a means to reduce bad bot hits from all over the web)
* Creates a limited shell access environment. This gives your additional created users the ability to interact with their seedbox via ssh on port 4747 w/o having access to other users shells and/or root/sudo commands and functions.

## Installed software
* ruTorrent 3.7 + official plugins
* rTorrent 0.9.6
* libTorrrent 0.13.6
* mktorrent
* Linux Quota
* SSH Server (for SSH terminal and sFTP connections)
* pureftp - vsftp (CuteFTP multi-segmented download friendly ya'll)
* IRSSI
* Plex
* BTSync
* LShell

### Quick Box Seedbox Dashboard - Video Preview
> As of version 1.6.5 (latest) the stuttering issues with server load average and uptime on refresh are fixed. These stats are updated every 1/sec. Additionally, all stats you see on the dashboard are dynamically updated via ajax. Example - add a torrent - the torrents number will update as will diskspace etc... this is done without needing to refresh the page.

## Main ruTorrent plugins

## Additional ruTorrent plugins

## Before installation
You need to have a Fresh "blank" server installation.
After that access your box using a SSH client, like PuTTY.

## Warnings

#### If you don't know Linux ENOUGH:

DO NOT attempt to install NGINX as a frontend proxy if you plan to use Transdroid (http://www.transdroid.org/). Doing so will cause the app to either not connect or crash repeatedly

DO NOT use capital letters, all the usernames should be written in lowercase.

DO NOT upgrade anything in the box, feel free to open an issue and ask before attempting this on a current (in production) server.

DO NOT try to reconfigure packages using other tutorials - this script (AS IS) is designed to work with what's included.

### INFO:

#### Files List:
  * jquery.browser.js - update JS file
  * jquery.browser.min.js - Updated JS file
  * plugins [directory] - rutorrent plugins
  * quick-box.sh - quick-box seedbox prep installer script
  * quickbox-ubuntu.sh - quick-box seedbox master installer script for Ubuntu 14.04, 15.04, and 15.10
  * rutorrent - rutorrent web folder
  * rutorrent-quickbox-dark.zip - Custom quick-box ruTorrent skin

  * sources [directory] - Folder containing rtorrent/libtorrent
  * commands [directory] - Folder containing various functions for user creation etc. _if you desire them_
  * xmlrpc-c - xmlrpc-c source

#### Known Bugs/Fixes
  1. Fix the private flag when new torrent is made
   ``` 
   sed -i 's/\$torrent->is_private(true);/\$torrent->is_private(false);/g' /var/www/rutorrent/plugins/create/createtorrent.php 
   ```
  2. Currently CuteFTP can only connect to your ${username} seedbox home directory via FTP on port 5757. I am going to be looking further into allowing CuteFTP a connection on SFTP for added security. That is, if I am not completley limited by GlobalScapes software practices.

#### BUILDING ERRORS
  * If ffmpeg/rtorrent/libtorrent/xmlrpc-c fails to build.. check /etc/fstab for 'noexec' flag (_but this should be fixed_)
